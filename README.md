# Xavier Statistics

### Todo: Add readme

### Todo: Add Service to overclock the jetson, nodes will use /xavier/overclock std_srvs/SetBool to overclock the CPU or switch back to normal state. Better power management ðŸ˜Ž

### Todo: move the tegrastats executable under scripts/ folder :D

### TODO: in the mail launch file check if the current operating is jetson, otherwise don't run the package. :D

### Maybe add a node, that will have a service like /node/get_current_os which will return OSX JETSON or UBUNTU etc. therefore when a node wants to use this packages features it will know that this is not a jetson hardware
